# esche.rs
Rust oriented workshop exploring functional geometry.

## Inspiration
This workshop is heavily inspired by the excellent workshop 
[Escher in Elm][escher-in-elm] by the awesome [Einar Host][host]. His workshop
in turn was based on the 1982 classic paper [functional geometry][funcgeo], or
at least the revision from 2002.
