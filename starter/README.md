# `eschers`
`Rust` starter code exploring functional geometry.

## Prerequisites
`Rust` version should be `1.26` or higher.

## What to do if there is no Internet connection.
We've prepared a directory containing all cargo dependencies, which will come in
handy if you're using this workshop package in a situation where internet
connections are spotty or non-existent.

To use this setup, set `CARGO_HOME` before proceeding to the location of the
cargo_home directory in this package.

On Linux/macOS:

```
export CARGO_HOME=/...where you've unpacked.../cargo_home
```

On Windows:

```
set CARGO_HOME=C:\...where you've unpacked...\cargo_home
```

Afterwards, cd to the appropriate directory and run cargo as usual:

```
cargo build ...
cargo run ...
```
