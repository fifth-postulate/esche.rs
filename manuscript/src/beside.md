# Beside
<img src="image/d_beside_b.svg" alt="The letter d & b beside each other" width="400px" height="400px">

What to do now is very similar what you did in the previous chapter. Instead of
stacking pictures horizontally, you are going to "stack" them vertically.

<div class="reference">
  <img src="image/box.svg" alt="The standard box for reference" width="400px" height="400px">
  <img src="image/box_beside_box.svg" alt="Two boxes beside each other" width="400px" height="400px">
</div>

## Implement
Copy and pasting and changing horizontally in vertically will bring this
chapters goal within reach. And there is nothing wrong with that.

But if you want to challenge yourself, you could also think of using the tools
already present. By cleverly combining turns and above one can get beside.

Either way, once you created beside, make sure to test it out. And say goodbye
to `src/canvas/mod.rs`, you won't need to touch it again. All the primitive
operations are in place.
