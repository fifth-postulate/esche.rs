# Box
We learned about _the grid method_. It allows us to instruct an artist that
knows how copy a picture from a grid, how we want the picture copied. This can
be achieved by controlling the grid the artist will copy the picture into. The
grid method relies on a box. So we better should get to know our boxes.

Above you find a pictorial representation of a _box_. It is defined by three
vectors, `a`, which is red in the picture, `b` which is orange in the picture
and `c` which is purple in the picture.
