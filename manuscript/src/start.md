# The letter d
You need to walk before you run. So instead of starting with drawing fish, we
will take a look at the letter d.

The letter d is a recognizable shape that does not have a lot of _symmetries_.
I.e. If you rotate it or flip it, it doesn't look lite itself anymore. This
isn't true for the letter H for example.

By focusing on the letter d and transforming it, we can figure out how to change
our box. This is hard work, but very rewarding.

If you follow along and implement the functions laid out by the next chapters,
you are well on your way to reproducing Eschers Square Limit.
