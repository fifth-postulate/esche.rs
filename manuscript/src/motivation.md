# Motivation

It was the year 1982 when 
[Peter Henderson](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/peter), publishes a paper
called _Functional Geometry_. In it he describes an algebra of pictures that
allowed him to recreate [Escher's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher)
_Square Limit_.

The 2002 reprint of [the article](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/257577/1/funcgeo2.pdf)
inspires [Einar Host](https://einarwh.wordpress.com/) to give a 
[talk](https://einarwh.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/picture-combinators-and-recursive-fish/)
and a [workshop](https://github.com/einarwh/escher-workshop).

I was lucky enough to attend that workshop at 
[Booster Conf](https://2018.boosterconf.no/). I had such a good time that I
translated the workshop to Rust.

I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did, when I first learned how to recreate
Escher's Square Limit in code.
